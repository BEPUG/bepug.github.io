- __Modernizing PowerShell Scripts__ by [Matthias van den Elsacker](https://sessionize.com/Matthias-vdE/)
- __Git(Hub) 101__ by [Stijn & Merlijn](https://bepug.dev/about)

Introducing peer to peer learning sessions open to all new PowerShell enthousiasts. Bring your laptop and show us the PowerShell challenge you're struggling with. We'll do our best to help you understand the concepts and guide you through some best practices of coding in PowerShell.
After all, that's what a user group is about :)
